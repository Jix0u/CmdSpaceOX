## Inspiration 
Bad posture and the lack of exercise in the pandemic

## How we built it
Using Python scripts and Mediapipe API to track hand gestures and hand location. Then used pyautogui to mouve mouse with the calculated values.
Then use Electron and React for the App interface and Microsoft Azure for Speech Recognition.
